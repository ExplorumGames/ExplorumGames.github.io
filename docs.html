        <h2>Installation Guide</h2>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 1: Preparation</h3>
            <p>Firstly, if you found this site on your own, you are out of luck as it is meant for specific schools, but if you were sent here by someone who is in your school, you are in luck! Heres how to get started, email anonymouswallabe@yahoo.com with your real name and write that you are here for ExplorumGames, you will be provided a license key, you need this license key for the following steps!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 2: Installation</h3>
            <p>Click the download app button at the top of this page and a file named Install should be downloaded to your device, to get started, run this file. Enter your license key, then wait until it tells you that it is done (Ignore any errors). Once completed, you are ready to move on to the next steps!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 3: Configuration</h3>
            <p>Now that everything is installed, it is time to set it up so you can actually download and play/launch games! Here is how: start by opening the My Apps folder on your desktop (if it is not there, please email anonymouswallabe@yahoo.com for support), in there is a file named Launcher, open that file. Then click extract all at the top right of the menu, then click extract, now you should be in the extracted copy of the folder. First close all your windows, now open the My Apps folder from you desktop again, in there, there are now two things named Launcher, delete the one that has a zipped folder icon and keep the normal folder one. Now open the normal folder one and inside of it open the 7-Zip folder, in there you should see a file named "Setup", go ahead and open that once (it wont show anything apart from maybe an instant popup) Now close the window and everything is setup, now it is time to enjoy your games by moving on to the next step!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 4: Launch</h3>
            <p>Every time you want to download or play any of your games, simply open My Apps, then launcher, and in there is a file named GameLauncher, it will take a while to open, don't try opening it again and DO NOT be alarmed. Once it opens, enter your license key one more time (you only have to do this once) and you will be greeted with a menu allowing you to download Steam games onto your device. Once downloaded, simply click Play to enjoy gaming on your school device! It's as Shrimple as that! Quick tip: Make sure to keep track of your storage to make sure you don't fill up your storage all the way, sadly this means you can't download absolutely huge games if your school device does not have a lot of storage. One last thing before you go, sharing your license key / letting anyone else use it will lead to the immediate termination of your license key (yes it detects it), blocking your access to ExplorumGames for good! Also our game library is constantly expanding, and we will happily add any game that is available on Steam that you send to us, simply email anonymouswallabe@yahoo.com with the game name or Steam link. Now have fun and enjoy! :D :) :D :)</p>
